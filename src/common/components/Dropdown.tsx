// Stub for common component: Dropdown
//
//   common components are esentially wrappers for Material UI components
//   we are creating wrappers in order to maintain consistent style between all teams
//
//   if you need a component that hasn't been implemented go ahead and set it up!
//     docs:  https://material-ui.com/
//   after implementing the component request someone from the React team for review

const Dropdown = () => {
  throw new Error('Dropdown has not been defined');
};

export { Dropdown };
